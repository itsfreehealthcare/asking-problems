## We Want to Hear From You! ðŸ’¡

We're building towards our mission of **Free Healthcare for All**, and your ideas matter. Whether you've identified a problem that needs solving or have a vision for a new feature, we want to hear about it.

## How to Suggest Ideas

Have an idea that could help people access better healthcare? Here's how to share it:

1. **Check existing issues** - See if someone has already suggested something similar
2. **Open a new issue** - Use our issue templates to describe your idea
3. **Be specific** - Help us understand the problem you're trying to solve and who it would help

## What We're Looking For

- Problems you've experienced or observed in healthcare access
- Feature ideas that align with our mission
- Solutions that could help underserved communities
- Improvements to existing functionality

## Guidelines

- Keep suggestions focused and actionable
